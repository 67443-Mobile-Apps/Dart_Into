Some Dart Basics
===

These are some exercises that review some of the basics of Dart.  Most were reviewed in class, but there is some new material, so students are advised to review all the code.  The code can be run in VS Code if properly configured with the Dart extension or can be run in [DartPad](https://www.dartpad.dev/?null_safety=true) as we did in class.
